Because I am bad at hacking, I mainly just swapped everything around, which makes reading the repo very confusing. In my dropbox link over at Pokecommunity forums, I have also attached the 
excel master document, which details all of the swaps I did to make this game. If you wish to edit this pret, I suggest downloading that file first.
