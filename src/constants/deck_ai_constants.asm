; used as input for AIProcessEnergyCards to determine what to check
; and whether to play card after the routine is over.
; I suspect AI_ENERGY_FLAG_DONT_PLAY to be a flag to signal the routine
; not to actually play the energy card after it's finished,
; but AIProcessEnergyCards checks whether ANY flag is set in order
; to decide not to play it, so it's redundant in the presence of another flag.
